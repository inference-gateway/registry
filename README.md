A modern web application for managing and discovering agent-to-agent (A2A) services in the inference-gateway ecosystem. This registry serves as a centralized hub for containerized agents that provide specialized services and can communicate with each other autonomously.

## Overview

The Agents Registry is built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite, providing a fast and responsive interface for browsing available agents. Each agent is packaged as an OCI container and includes rich metadata about its capabilities, usage, and integration requirements.

## Features

- **Agent Discovery**: Browse and search through available agents by name, description, or tags
- **Category Filtering**: Organize agents by their primary function and use case
- **Container Information**: View OCI container details including repository, tags, and image sizes
- **Rich Metadata**: Access comprehensive information about each agent's capabilities and requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with dark theme and smooth animations
- **Documentation Integration**: Built-in guides and setup instructions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Architecture

The registry uses a static build approach where agent metadata is defined in YAML files and processed at build time:

- **Agent Metadata**: YAML files in `/agents/` directory define each agent's specifications
- **Custom YAML Plugin**: Vite plugin converts YAML to JavaScript modules for type-safe imports
- **Static Generation**: No backend required - can be deployed to any static hosting service
- **Agent Data Flow**: YAML → Build-time processing → Static imports → React components

## Adding New Agents

1. Create a new directory under `/agents/` for your agent
2. Add a `metadata.yaml` file with the agent specification
3. Rebuild the application to include the new agent
4. The agent will automatically appear in the registry
